# CreditCardFinancialDashboard
**Project Overview**
This project involves the development of an interactive Credit Card Financial Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and visualize transaction and customer data stored in a SQL database. The dashboard provides real-time insights into key financial metrics such as revenue, transaction volume, customer segmentation, and spending behavior, helping stakeholders make informed business decisions.

**Objectives**
The main objective of this project is to:
Provide a comprehensive view of the credit card business using financial and customer data.
Enable real-time tracking of revenue, transaction count, and other key performance indicators.
Segment customers based on income, job roles, card usage, and spending patterns.
Share actionable insights with stakeholders to enhance business performance.

**Data Sources**
The project uses two primary datasets:
Customer Data: Contains demographic and financial details such as customer income, job role, education level, and card category.
Transaction Data: Captures all transactions made using credit cards, along with revenue generated, card type, and expenditure category.
The datasets are stored in a SQL database and were imported into Power BI for visualization and analysis.

**Key Features of the Dashboard**
Revenue Analysis: Tracks total revenue generated and trends over different time periods.
Customer Segmentation: Segments customers based on job type, education level, income, and card type, helping identify high-value customer groups.
Spending Patterns: Analyzes expenditure across various categories like grocery, bills, travel, and entertainment.
Card Usage: Visualizes usage trends across different credit card types (e.g., Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum).
