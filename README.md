# Credit Card Financial Dashboard

### Project Overview
This project involves developing an interactive Credit Card Financial Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides real-time insights into transaction and customer data, allowing business leaders and marketing analysts to analyze revenue trends, customer segmentation, and spending patterns to make informed decisions.

### Objectives
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor revenue, transaction volume, and other key performance indicators on a weekly and quarterly basis.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyze customer data based on age, income, job roles, card type, and spending behavior.
- **Spending Insights**: Understand expenditure patterns across categories such as grocery, entertainment, bills, and travel.

### Key Features
- **Revenue Analysis**: Real-time visualization of revenue trends by week, quarter, and card category.
- **Customer Segmentation**: DAX-based segmentation to categorize customers by demographics and income group.
- **Spending Patterns**: Detailed breakdown of spending habits across various categories.
- **Card Usage Analysis**: Insights into credit card usage by type and transaction method (e.g., Swipe, Chip, Online).

### Data Sources
- **Customer Data**: Contains demographic and financial details (e.g., age, income, job, education, card category).
- **Transaction Data**: Includes transaction details, revenue generated, card type, and expenditure category.
  
Data was extracted from a SQL database and imported into Power BI for analysis and visualization.

### DAX Calculations
Some of the key DAX calculations used in this project include:
- **Customer Age Group**: Categorizes customers by age brackets (20-30, 30-40, etc.).
- **Income Group**: Segments customers into Low, Medium, and High income categories.
- **Revenue Calculations**: Summation of annual fees, transaction amounts, and interest earned.
- **Weekly Revenue Comparison**: Comparison of current and previous weekâ€™s revenue.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboarding.
- **SQL**: For data extraction and transformation.
- **DAX**: Used for calculated fields and segmentation in Power BI.

### Results and Impact
